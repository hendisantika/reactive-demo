# Spring 5 :: reactive controller

This project demonstrates how to implement a very basic reactive controller in Spring. 
 
It is based on Spring 5 milestone 1 - and work-in-progress reactive modules.

(Spring 5 wasn't ready at the time of writing. So expect changes to dependencies and possibly also the source code.)
